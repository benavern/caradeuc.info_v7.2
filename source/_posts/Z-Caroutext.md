Hi,

Just a quick article for a very little project :

Yes I made an other project, not very usefull but it took me some time to be able to make it work, this is a text caroussel.

I made it with only [VanillaJs](http://vanilla-js.com/) (pure javascript) and wanted it to respect the Object Oriented Programmation rules.

I called it [Z-Caroutext](http://benavern.github.io/z-caroutext)
