## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Benjamin Caradeuc. I am an engineering student at the ENIB (Ecole Nationale des Ing√©nieurs de Brest) in France, and not far to obtain his diploma.

I like programming and especially web sites and web apps.

Not yet very present on the web for my work, I'd like to share some of the things I do and put on GitHub, so that people will be able to use them and hopefully like or love them.

Thank's to this blog, I'll be able to try this blogging plateform : *hubpress* and in the same time, I'll try to inform about my projects and every thought I have about programming or not.
