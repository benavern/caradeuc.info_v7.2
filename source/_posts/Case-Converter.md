Hi,

Today I'm excited to announce I developped a new chrome extension. It is inspired from the [lowertoupper](https://benavern.github.io/2015/04/10/lowertoupper.html) node webkit application I made some time ago...

## Download link

It is already available on the chrome webstore [HERE](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/case-converter/eopaojcdjbiipnebdkfjfaooogefklbf).

## About

This is just a little tool I made to convert text to lower and upper case easily.

Don't hesitate to fork, pull request, notify me for bugs, give ideas to improve it...

The project page is [HERE](https://benavern.github.io/caseconverter)

_See you next project ;)_
