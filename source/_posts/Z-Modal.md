Today, the "Z" library is welcoming a new plugin!

As usual, I developped it without any third party library or framework, so it is usable as-is. This tool will allow you to create beautiful & customisable modals easily with callback interactions.

There is a set of options and methods you will be able to use, everything is explained [in the documentation](http://blog.caradeuc.info/z-modal).
