Hi again,

_This is the first thing I'll share here._

## What is it?

*lowertoupper* is a node webkit app that permits you to convert a text in lower and upper case.

## Why did I do that?

_There is its little history :_

Once, my girlfriend asked me if there was something easy to convert some words from lower to upper case and vice versa, I was not able to answer her...

So, because I am a *web programmer* and I eard about *node webkit*, I said myself I'd test it and help her in the same time.

This is the result of what I gave here. She was happy with it, and I was happy too being able to code a software with my only knowledge in web programming.

## What does it look like?
