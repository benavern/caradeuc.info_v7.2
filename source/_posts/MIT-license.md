Hi,

It's been a long time I have not published anything here but now I come back and share something that will be useful for a lot of my projects and maybe yours...

---

## My problem

A little bit bored from having to add a license to each of my projects, READMEs, etc...

---

## My solution

I decided to create a github page for the MIT license (the one I use for a lot of my projects) filled with my information.

But when you do that and know that you only have to change your name and optionaly provide a link, you tell yourself, "What else???".

As a good developper, you want your creation to be usefull for other people!

This is what I did :

https://benavern.github.io/MIT/

## HowTo

To personalize it, you just have to add some search-like information in the url's hash

* `name` :  yours or your companies
* `link` : (optional) a URL or mailto link to give the visitor a chance to contact you

---

## Demo

Take me, my name is `Benjamin Caradeuc` and my personal website (where you can find how to contact me) is located at `http://caradeuc.info/`

The URL will be :

https://benavern.github.io/MIT#name=Benjamin%20Caradeuc&link=http%3A//caradeuc.info/

Don't forget to escape the data that you put in the url for a better compatibility!

---

## Anonymous

If you don't want to personalize the page, you can pass a space in the name parameter. The space escaped code is `%20`, so the url will be :

https://benavern.github.io/MIT#name=%20

This will result in an anonymous license text.

If you like (or if you don't) that project, let me know in the comments below!

__See you next hack ;-)__
