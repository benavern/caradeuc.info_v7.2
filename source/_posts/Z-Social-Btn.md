Hi,

Today, I just want to share something I did on codepen just for fun and to test again jade & scss...  [Z Social BTN](http://codepen.io/benavern/pen/yNPVab/)

<p data-height="603" data-theme-id="0" data-slug-hash="yNPVab" data-default-tab="result" data-user="benavern" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/benavern/pen/yNPVab/'>z social btn</a> by Benjamin CARADEUC (<a href='http://codepen.io/benavern'>@benavern</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

These are just a set of social sharing buttons that you could use on your blogs, websites ...

Codepen seams to be a very good tool for front-end programmers as well as web designers, and I find very interesting things on it everyday.
