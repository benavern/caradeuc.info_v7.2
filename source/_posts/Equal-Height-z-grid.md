Hi,

Today, I just made a little jQuery script that permits you to make your grid system's boxes the same height on same lines : [Equal Height](http://labo.caradeuc.info/equalheight)

---

You just have to insert the `equalheight` class on each box that has to be resized and you're done.

Examples are done with [z-grid](/2015/05/27/Z-Grid/), a lightweight grid system I created but it can be used on a ton of other grid systems.

---

It is also available [on github](http://github.com/benavern/equalheight)
